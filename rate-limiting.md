rate limiting

write a summary of functionality associated with rate limiting service mesh requests based on envoy filters

Envoy filters in service mesh manage and control request traffic rates. They offer functionality to regulate requests:

Rate Control: Limit incoming requests per unit of time.
Global and Per-Service Limits: Set limits globally or per-service.
HTTP Method and Header Rules: Enforce limits based on methods and headers.
Dynamic Rule Updates: Adjust limits in real-time.
Fail-Open/Closed: Choose how to handle exceeding limits.
Metrics Integration: Monitor and analyze traffic patterns.
Distributed Systems Support: Enforce limits across clusters.
Quotas and Burst Limits: Set long-term quotas and short-term burst limits.
Security: Defend against abuse and attacks.
Response Handling: Define responses when limits are exceeded.

Open-Source Istio:

Community-Driven: Open-source Istio is community-maintained and cloud-agnostic.
Customization: Offers flexibility and control over configuration.
Multi-Cloud: Works on various Kubernetes clusters.
Responsibility: Requires manual control and maintenance.
AKS Istio Addon:

Azure Integration: Specific to Azure, managed by Azure.
Managed Service: Simplifies deployment and management.
Simplified Setup: Easily enabled as an AKS addon.
Integration with Azure: Seamlessly works with Azure services.
Limited Customization: Less user customization, Azure-managed.

#####
api management

Azure API Management's rate limiting functionality enables control and management of incoming requests to APIs. Key features include:

Request Throttling: Limiting the number of requests an API can receive within a set time frame.

Rate Limit Policies: Customizable policies for fine-grained control.

Quota Management: Setting total request limits over longer periods.

Key and Subscription-Based Limits: Enforcing limits based on keys.

Custom Error Responses: Responding with custom errors when limits are exceeded.

Granular Control: Limiting based on dimensions like IP or user.

Burst Limiting: Allowing brief request spikes beyond limits.

Rate Limit Monitoring: Analytics for tracking usage.

Dynamic Rate Limiting: Real-time adjustment of limits.

Flexible Configuration: Configurable through the portal, developer portals, or APIs.

###
custom middleware

Custom rate limiting middleware controls incoming requests with these functions:

Custom Rate Limits: Set rules, e.g., requests per IP or endpoint.
Real-time Tracking: Monitors requests in real-time.
Granular Control: Fine-tunes limits for specific users or endpoints.
Throttling: Delays requests when limits are reached.
Custom Responses: Defines error messages for exceeded limits.
Dynamic Config: Supports real-time rule adjustments.
Whitelisting/Blacklisting: Manages trusted or malicious sources.
Logging/Monitoring: Offers insights for traffic analysis.
Integration: Easily fits into your application framework.
Load Balancer Support: Ensures consistent enforcement across instances.

#####
dapr

Dapr offers rate limiting features with the following functions:

Global and Per-Endpoint Limits: Set rate limits for the entire application or specific endpoints.
Dynamic Configuration: Allows real-time adjustments to rate limits without application redeployment.
Response Handling: Custom responses are returned when rate limits are exceeded.
Integration: Dapr seamlessly integrates into various programming languages and frameworks.
Distributed Systems Support: Manages rate limiting across multiple instances and services in distributed systems.
Metrics and Observability: Integrates with monitoring tools for traffic insights.
Load Balancer Compatibility: Ensures consistent rate limit enforcement across application instances.


#####
functional
